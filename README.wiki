§ wiki-logs

Application **wiki-logs** creates a **logs** page (a page that lists all the logs) using the **wiki/1** file-format.

For example:

	wiki-logs --output=logs.wiki

❦

You can set the value of the 'output' by creating the dot-file ".wiki-logs_output", whose content is the name of the file where you want the output to go.

And then you can run **wiki-logs** like this:

	wiki-logs

Else, you can run **wiki-logs** using the 'output' switch:

	wiki-logs -v --output=path/to/logs.wiki

... if you want to create the //logs file// at the path and file-name you specify.

Running that last comman would created the directory:

	path/to

And would create the file:

	path/to/logs.wiki
